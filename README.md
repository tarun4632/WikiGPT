# WikiGPT - A Smart Document and Wiki Query Handler

WikiGPT is a project designed to efficiently query a vector store or Wikipedia for answers to user questions. It uses LangChain, AstraDB, and other modern libraries to streamline the process of routing questions to the most relevant source.

## Features
- Query a vector store containing specialized documents.
- Perform Wikipedia searches for general topics.
- Route questions intelligently using a trained model.
- Visualize workflows using LangGraph.
- Compatible with Llama 3.1 and HuggingFace embeddings.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- AstraDB account
- API keys for AstraDB and Groq

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/WikiGPT.git
    cd WikiGPT
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Add your AstraDB and Groq API keys in the code or use environment variables:
    ```python
    ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "your-astra-token"
    ASTRA_DB_ID = "your-db-id"
    ASTRA_DB_ENDPOINT = "your-db-endpoint"
    os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "your-groq-api-key"
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook WikiGPT.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. Open `WikiGPT.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells to load documents, split them, and create a vector store.
3. Use the question router to query either the vector store or Wikipedia based on the context of your question.
4. View the workflow graph visualization generated by LangGraph.

## Example Queries
- "What is an agent?" (Queries the vector store)
- "Who are Avengers?" (Queries Wikipedia)

## Learning and Template Use
This project is designed for learning purposes and provides a foundation for building advanced question-answering systems. It can also serve as a template for creating customized query handlers and integrating vector stores with external data sources like Wikipedia.

## Dependencies
